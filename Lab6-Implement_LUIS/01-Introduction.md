# Lab 6: Implement the LUIS model

## Introduction

We're going to build an end-to-end scenario that allows you to pull in your own pictures, use Cognitive Services to find objects and people in the images, and obtain a description and tags. We'll later build a Bot Framework bot using LUIS to allow easy, targeted querying.

> **Note** In this lab, we will only be creating the LUIS model that you will use in a future lab to build a more intelligent bot.
