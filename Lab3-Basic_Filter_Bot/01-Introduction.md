# Lab 3: Basic Filtering Bot

## Introduction

In this lab, we will be setting up an intelligent bot from end-to-end that can respond to a user's chat window text prompt. We will be building on what we have already learned about building bots within Azure, but adding in a layer of custom logic to give our bot more bespoke functionality.

This bot will be built in the Microsoft Bot Framework. We will evoke the architecture that enables the bot interface to receive and respond with textual messages, and we will build logic that enables our bot to respond to inquiries containing specific text.

We will also be testing our bot in the Bot Emulator, and addressing the middleware that enables us to perform specialized tasks on the message that the bot receives from the user.

We will evoke some concepts pertaining to Azure Search, and Microsoft's Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), but will not implement them in this lab.
