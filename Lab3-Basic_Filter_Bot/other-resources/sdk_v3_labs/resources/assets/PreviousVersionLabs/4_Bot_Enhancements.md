### Lab: Regular expressions and scorable groups

There are a number of things that we can do to improve our bot.  First of all, we may not want to call LUIS for a simple "hi" greeting, which the bot will get fairly frequently from its users.  A simple regular expression could match this, and save us time (due to network latency) and money (due to cost of calling the LUIS service).  

Also, as the complexity of our bot grows, and we are taking the user's input and using multiple services to interpret it, we need a process to manage that flow.  For example, try regular expressions first, and if that doesn't match, call LUIS, and then perhaps we also drop down to try other services like [QnA Maker](http://qnamaker.ai) and Azure Search.  A great way to manage this is [ScorableGroups](https://blog.botframework.com/2017/07/06/Scorables/).  ScorableGroups give you an attribute to impose an order on these service calls.  In our code, let's impose an order of matching on regular expressions first, then calling LUIS for interpretation of utterances, and finally lowest priority is to drop down to a generic "I'm not sure what you mean" response.    

To use ScorableGroups, your RootDialog will need to inherit from DispatchDialog instead of LuisDialog (but you can still have the LuisModel attribute on the class).  You also will need a reference to Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Scorables (as well as others).  So in your RootDialog.cs file, add:

```csharp

using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Scorables;
using System.Collections.Generic;

```

and change your class derivation to:

```csharp

    public class RootDialog : DispatchDialog<object>

```

Then let's add some new methods that match regular expressions as our first priority in ScorableGroup 0.  Add the following at the beginning of your RootDialog class:

```csharp

        [RegexPattern("^hello")]
        [RegexPattern("^hi")]
        [ScorableGroup(0)]
        public async Task Hello(IDialogContext context, IActivity activity)
        {
            await context.PostAsync("Hello from RegEx!  I am a Photo Organization Bot.  I can search your photos, share your photos on Twitter, and order prints of your photos.  You can ask me things like 'find pictures of food'.");
        }

        [RegexPattern("^help")]
        [ScorableGroup(0)]
        public async Task Help(IDialogContext context, IActivity activity)
        {
            // Launch help dialog with button menu  
            List<string> choices = new List<string>(new string[] { "Search Pictures", "Share Picture", "Order Prints" });
            PromptDialog.Choice<string>(context, ResumeAfterChoice, 
                new PromptOptions<string>("How can I help you?", options:choices));
        }

        private async Task ResumeAfterChoice(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<string> result)
        {
            string choice = await result;
            
            switch (choice)
            {
                case "Search Pictures":
                    PromptDialog.Text(context, ResumeAfterSearchTopicClarification,
                        "What kind of picture do you want to search for?");
                    break;
                case "Share Picture":
                    await SharePic(context, null);
                    break;
                case "Order Prints":
                    await OrderPic(context, null);
                    break;
                default:
                    await context.PostAsync("I'm sorry. I didn't understand you.");
                    break;
            }
        }

```

This code will match on expressions from the user that start with "hi", "hello", and "help".  Notice that when the user asks for help, we present him/her with a simple menu of buttons on the three core things our bot can do: search pictures, share pictures, and order prints.  

> Fun Aside: One might argue that the user shouldn't have to type "help" to get a menu of clear options on what the bot can do; rather, this should be the default experience on first contact with the bot.  **Discoverability** is one of the biggest challenges for bots - letting the users know what the bot is capable of doing.  Good [bot design principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/bot-design-principles) can help.   

This setup makes it so we call LUIS as our second attempt if no regular expression matches, in Scorable Group 1.  

The "None" intent in LUIS means that the utterance didn't map to any intent.  In this situation, we want to fall down to the next level of ScorableGroup.  Modify your "None" method in the RootDialog class as follows:

```csharp

        [LuisIntent("")]
        [LuisIntent("None")]
        [ScorableGroup(1)]
        public async Task None(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
        {
            // Luis returned with "None" as the winning intent,
            // so drop down to next level of ScorableGroups.  
            ContinueWithNextGroup();
        }

```

On the "Greeting" method, add a ScorableGroup attribute and add "from LUIS" to differentiate.  When you run your code, try saying "hi" and "hello" (which should be caught by the RegEx match) and then say "greetings" or "hey there" (which may be caught by LUIS, depending on how you trained it).  Note which method responds.  

```csharp

        [LuisIntent("Greeting")]
        [ScorableGroup(1)]
        public async Task Greeting(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
        {
            // Duplicate logic, for a teachable moment on Scorables.  
            await context.PostAsync("Hello from LUIS!  I am a Photo Organization Bot.  I can search your photos, share your photos on Twitter, and order prints of your photos.  You can ask me things like 'find pictures of food'.");
        }

```

Then, add the ScorableGroup attribute to your "SearchPics" method and your "OrderPic" method.  

```csharp

        [LuisIntent("SearchPics")]
        [ScorableGroup(1)]
        public async Task SearchPics(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
        {
            ...
        }

        [LuisIntent("OrderPic")]
        [ScorableGroup(1)]
        public async Task OrderPic(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
        {
            ...
        }

```

> Extra credit (to complete later): create an OrderDialog class in your "Dialogs" folder.  Create a process for ordering prints with the bot using [FormFlow](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/forms.html).  Your bot will need to collect the following information: Photo size (8x10, 5x7, wallet, etc.), number of prints, glossy or matte finish, user's phone number, and user's email.

You can update your "SharePic" method as well.  This contains a little code to show how to do a prompt for a yes/no confirmation as well as setting the ScorableGroup.  This code doesn't actually post a tweet because we didn't want to spend time getting everyone set up with Twitter developer accounts and such, but you are welcome to implement if you want.  

```csharp

        [LuisIntent("SharePic")]
        [ScorableGroup(1)]
        public async Task SharePic(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
        {
            PromptDialog.Confirm(context, AfterShareAsync,
                "Are you sure you want to tweet this picture?");            
        }

        private async Task AfterShareAsync(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<bool> result)
        {
            if (result.GetAwaiter().GetResult() == true)
            {
                // Yes, share the picture.
                await context.PostAsync("Posting tweet.");
            }
            else
            {
                // No, don't share the picture.  
                await context.PostAsync("OK, I won't share it.");
            }
        }

```

Finally, add a default handler if none of the above services were able to understand.  This ScorableGroup needs an explicit MethodBind because it is not decorated with a LuisIntent or RegexPattern attribute (which include a MethodBind).

```csharp

        // Since none of the scorables in previous group won, the dialog sends a help message.
        [MethodBind]
        [ScorableGroup(2)]
        public async Task Default(IDialogContext context, IActivity activity)
        {
            await context.PostAsync("I'm sorry. I didn't understand you.");
            await context.PostAsync("You can tell me to find photos, tweet them, and order prints.  Here is an example: \"find pictures of food\".");
        }

```

Hit F5 to run your bot and test it in the Bot Emulator.  

### Lab: Publish your bot

A bot created using the Microsoft Bot can be hosted at any publicly-accessible URL.  For the purposes of this lab, we will host our bot in an Azure website/app service.  

In the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio, right-click on your Bot Application project and select "Publish".  This will launch a wizard to help you publish your bot to Azure.  

Select the publish target of "Microsoft Azure App Service".  

![Publish Bot to Azure App Service](./resources/assets/PublishBotAzureAppService.png) 

On the App Service screen, select the appropriate subscription and click "New". Then enter an API app name, subscription, the same resource group that you've been using thus far, and an app service plan.  

![Create App Service](./resources/assets/CreateAppService.jpg) 

Finally, you will see the Web Deploy settings, and can click "Publish".  The output window in Visual Studio will show the deployment process.  Then, your bot will be hosted at a URL like http://testpicturebot.azurewebsites.net/, where "testpicturebot" is the App Service API app name.  

### Lab: Register your bot with the Bot Connector

Go to a web browser and navigate to [http://dev.botframework.com](http://dev.botframework.com).  Click [Register a bot](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new).  Fill out your bot's name, handle, and description.  Your messaging endpoint will be your Azure website URL with "api/messages" appended to the end, like https://testpicturebot.azurewebsites.net/api/messages.  

![Bot Registration](./resources/assets/BotRegistration.jpg) 

Then click the button to create a Microsoft App ID and password.  This is your Bot App ID and password that you will need in your Web.config.  Store your Bot app name, app ID, and app password in a safe place!  Once you click "OK" on the password, there is no way to get back to it.  Then click "Finish and go back to Bot Framework".  

![Bot Generate App Name, ID, and Password](./resources/assets/BotGenerateAppInfo.jpg) 

On the bot registration page, your app ID should have been automatically filled in.  You can optionally add an AppInsights instrumentation key for logging from your bot.  Check the box if you agree with the terms of service and click "Register".  

You are then taken to your bot's dashboard page, with a URL like https://dev.botframework.com/bots?id=TestPictureBot but with your own bot name. This is where we can enable various channels.  Two channels, Skype and Web Chat, are enabled automatically.  

Finally, you need to update your bot with its registration information.  Return to Visual Studio and open Web.config.  Update the BotId with the App Name, the MicrosoftAppId with the App ID, and the MicrosoftAppPassword with the App Password that you got from the bot registration site.  

```xml

    <add key="BotId" value="TestPictureBot" />
    <add key="MicrosoftAppId" value="95b76ae6-8643-4d94-b8a1-916d9f753a30" />
    <add key="MicrosoftAppPassword" value="kC200000000000000000000" />

```

Rebuild your project, and then right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select "Publish" again.  Your settings should be remembered from last time, so you can just hit "Publish". 

> Getting an error that directs you to your MicrosoftAppPassword? Because it's in XML, if your key contains "&", "<", ">", "'", or '"', you will need to replace those symbols with their respective [escape facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#Characters_and_escaping): "&amp;", "&lt;", "&gt;", "&apos;", "&quot;". 

Navigate back to your bot's dashboard (something like https://dev.botframework.com/bots?id=TestPictureBot).  Try talking to it in the Chat window.  The carousel may look different in Web Chat than the emulator.  There is a great tool called the Channel Inspector to see the user experience of various controls in the different channels at https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/channel-inspector/channels/Skype/#navtitle.  
From your bot's dashboard, you can add other channels, and try out your bot in Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Slack.  Simply click the "Add" button to the right of the channel name on your bot's dashboard, and follow the instructions.
