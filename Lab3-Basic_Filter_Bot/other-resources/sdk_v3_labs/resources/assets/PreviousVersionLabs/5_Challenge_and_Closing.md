## 5_Challenge_and_Closing

**Finish early? Try this extra credit lab:**

Try experimenting with more advanced Azure Search queries. Add term-boosting by extending your LUIS model to recognize entities like _"find happy people"_, mapping "happy" to "happiness" (the emotion returned from Cognitive Services), and turning those into boosted queries using [Term Boosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/Lucene-query-syntax-in-Azure-Search#bkmk_termboost). 

## Lab Completion

In this lab we covered creating an intelligent bot from end-to-end using the Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure Search and several Cognitive Services.
